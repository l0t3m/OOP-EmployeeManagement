OOP Assignment 1 - Employee Management System:
For debugging, we added a simple "DebugHelp" class that generates random developer or manager.
To use it and make your life easier, uncomment line 47 to 52 in the Program.cs file.
Please note: we havenâ€™t tested the code for invalid inputs, so go easy on it and use proper input :)
